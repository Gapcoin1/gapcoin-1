I.e. after mining x hours at 20000 primespersec you should find a block?<br />Or is it just totally random? There are people in the richlist that have 100+ coins. How did they manage to do that?<br /></div><br />Theoretically you will find a gap with merit m (~difficulty) within e^m prime gaps:<br /><br />e^20.45 = 760890487,&nbsp; so you will need to calculate about 760890487 primes to find a new block.<br /><br />If your primes per second are 25000 then you will need 760890487/25000 = 30435 seconds, which are about 8:30 hours.<br />So you will finde ~ 2.8 blocks per day.<br /><br />The rpc-call getmininginfo has a new value called gapsperday, which is calculated using the above formula.<br /><br /></div>

I know that reward also gets down but what about the second question?<br /><br /><br /></div><br />When mining Primecoin, you can easily betray the pool by modifying your miner to search only for smaller prime chains.<br />With Gapcoin, this is not possible.<br /><br />In detail:<br /><br />When you searching for prime chains, you use a sieve for filtering prime candidates.<br />If you search for a 10 chain, you sieve 10 times and eliminate all prime chain candidates that are smaller than 10.<br />The primecoin pool then for example credits you for submitted 10-chain candidates that are only 7,8 or 9-chains.<br /><br />If you now sieve only 7 times, you will get a lot more 7-chain candidates.<br />Not only is your calculating effort less, you will also find 7-chains that would not have been 10 chain candidates.<br />The important point is, your chance of finding 10 chains drops while your chances of finding 7 chains rises.<br /><br />Pool operators have to implement something to handle such &quot;betrayers&quot;.<br />With Gapcoin you don&#039;t have this additional effort.</div>

Can gapcoin find them or because of sieves it may pass primes (I am not sure i understand how sieves work)?<br /><br />I am kinda excited with primes lately. What should i read to understand how gapcoin finds gaps? Does it need really advanced mathematics?<br /></div><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>The algorithm:</b></span><br /><br />The average length of a prime gap with the starting prime p, is log(p), <br />which means that the average prime gap size increases with lager primes.<br /><br />Instead of the pure length, Gapcoin uses the merit of a prime gap,<br />which is the ratio of the gap&#039;s size to the average gap size. <br /><br />Let p be the prime starting a prime gap, then m = gapsize/log(p) will be the merit of this prime gap. <br />Also a pseudo random number is calculated from p to provide finer difficulty adjustment. <br /><br />Let rand(p) be a pseudo random function with 0 &lt; rand(p) &lt; 1 <br />Then, for a prime gap starting at prime p with size s, <br />the difficulty will be s/log(p) + 2/log(p) &#8727; rand(p), <br />where 2/log(p) is the average distance between a gap of size s and s + 2 (the next greater gap) in the proximity of p.<br /><br />When it actually comes to mining, there are two additional fields added to the Blockheader, named ?shift? and ?adder?. <br /><br />We will calculate the prime p as sha256(Blockheader) &#8727; 2^shift + adder. <br />As an additional criterion the adder has to be smaller than 2^shift to avoid that the PoW could be reused. <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Mining:</b></span><br /><br />For mining, PoWCore uses a basic prime sieve with some slightly improvements:<br /><br /><b>The sieving steps:</b><br /><br />Calculate the first n primes.<br />In the actual sieve we skip all even numbers, <br />because we want to only sieve the odd multiplies of each prime.<br /><br />So, we create an additional set of primes and multiply each with two.<br />Make sure the start_index of the sieve is divisible by two.<br /><br />Now calculate for each prime the first odd number in the sieve, <br />which is divisible by that prime (called pindex).<br /><br />For each prime p: mark the pindex as composite, <br />add 2 &#8727; p to pindex and mark it as composite,<br />&nbsp;redo till we reach the end of the sieve.<br /><br />For each remaining prime candidate, <br />check primality with the Fermat-pseudo-prime-test as it is faster than the Miller-Rabin-test <br />(Fermat is not as accurate as the Miller-Rabin and maybe some valid sieve results will not be accepted, but this should be very rare)<br /><br />Now scan the remaining (pseudo) primes for a big prime gap.<br /><br /><br /><b>Additional notes:</b><br /><br />start_index can be hash &#8727; 2^shift + [0, 2^shift)<br /><br />max sieve size depends on start index, and is limited by (hash + 2^shift) - start_index.<br /><br />shift can theoretically be in range [14, 2^16),<br />but nodes can choose to only accept shifts till a given amount (e.g. 512 for the main nodes)<br /><br /><br /><b>dcct&#039;s improvements</b><br /><br />We do not check every remaining prime candidate with the fermat test.<br />Instead we look how large the gap has to be to fit the required difficulty (max_length).<br /><br />Then we determine the first prime in the sieve (called pstart).<br />Now we scan the prime candidates in the range (pstart, pstart + max_length).<br />We start at the position (pstart + max_length) and scan every prime candidate in reverse order till we reach pstart.<br /><br />If we find a prime within the range (pstart, pstart + max_length)<br />we can skip all other prime candidates within that range and set pstart to that prime.<br /><br />We redo the above process till we reach the end of the sieve.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>So, to sum it up:</b><br /><br />Gapcoin is researching into the opposite problem than the one of your video above,<br />but the max prime gap problem and the twin prime conjecture are closely related,<br />so, maybe Gapcoin&#039;s prime gaps could help somehow proving it.<br /></div>

            <div class="postbody">Hi there,<br /><br />just wanted to give a little status update on the GPU-Miner.<br /><br />My current idea is to divide the sieve into parts of the required gap size, <br />then apply dcct&#039;s strategy to each of those parts, <br />by start testing prime candidates from the end of the part and skipping those parts which have a prime in it.<br /><br />One problem is, that you have to store the first found prime (if there is one) from the previous part in the current part, <br />to efficiently scan the whole sieve.<br />This and some other related problems lead into very difficult code.<br /><br />Currently it&#039;s produce invalid results most of the time,<br />but I still think that it will give a reasonable speed increase to be worth the effort.<br /><br /></div>

So the largest prime value(times 3) would ideally stop just short of the end of the sieve.<br /><br />So here is where a bit of math leg work comes in if you want to be precise. &nbsp;Absolute value of 33554432/3 is 11184810. &nbsp;The first prime less than that is 11184799. &nbsp;11184799*3 is 33554397 which fits nicely near the top of the seive. &nbsp;A check of bigprimes.net shows it as the 737948th prime and thus the number of primes for shift 25.<br /><br />Can someone verify if this logic is correct? &nbsp;I think the default primes is 500000, &nbsp;Maybe it could be more efficient? &nbsp;Also we could build a table of primes for different shift values, perhaps blocks would be found faster if everyone wasn&#039;t trying to scan 2^25 at the same time on each round.<br /></div><br />Since revision 4, the default values are the same as from dcct&#039;s mod:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><pre style="margin-top: 0; display: inline;">--shift 25 --sieve-primes 900000 --sieve-size 33554432 <br /></pre></div><br />In the beginning, we sieve with the first n primes. For the first 2063689 primes, every prime eliminates at least one candidate in the sieve.<br />For the primes behind that point, the possibility for eliminating a prime candidate in the sieve decreases.<br /><br />After sieving, the remaining prime candidates are scanned for prime gaps. When a prime is found while scanning the gap, the whole gap is skipped<br />and the miner scans the next possible gap in the sieve.<br /><br />A more detailed description can be found here: <a class="ul" href="https://github.com/gapcoin/Gapcoin-PoWCore">https://github.com/gapcoin/Gapcoin-PoWCore</a><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=822498.msg10704266#msg10704266">Quote from: pdazzl on 2015-03-08, 20:35:32</a></div><div class="quote">@j0nn9 - Any new performance improvements coming or nvidia miner?<br /></div><br />Since i don&#039;t have any Nvidia cards, I&#039;m not capable of porting the miner to Nvidia.<br /><br />I tried a lot to improve the cpu-miner by using the Chinese Reminder Theorem, but it seems that Gapcoin&#039;s restriction on the prime numbers make it impossible to use the full potential of this method, so the current method is still faster.<br /><br />From my point of view, the miner is probable at the performance limit, but maybe someone else does have some smart Ideas.<br /><br />Even if we are currently a step away from the highest merit record, Gapcoin almost daily finds new first known occurrence prime gaps,<br />these are prime gaps of a specific length for that no gap with a greater merit is known.<br /><br />Currently we have 589 of these records listed here:<br /><a class="ul" href="http://www.trnicely.net/gaps/g4k.html">Prime gaps from 4000 to 5998</a> <br /><a class="ul" href="http://www.trnicely.net/gaps/g6k.html">Prime gaps from 6000 to 7998</a><br /><br />Gapcoin frequently either beats its own records or breaks other new prime gap records.<br />I submit these records regularly to Dr. Nicely. <br />You can view the current new found records at these page: <a class="ul" href="http://gapcoin.org/primegaps-length.php">http://gapcoin.org/primegaps-length.php</a></div>
