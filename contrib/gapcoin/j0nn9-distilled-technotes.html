Can gapcoin find them or because of sieves it may pass primes (I am not sure i understand how sieves work)?<br />I am kinda excited with primes lately. What should i read to understand how gapcoin finds gaps? Does it need really advanced mathematics?</div><span style="font-size: 12pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>The algorithm:</b></span><br /><br />The average length of a prime gap with the starting prime <tt>p</tt>, is <tt>log(p)</tt>, which means that the average prime gap size increases with larger primes.<br /><br />Instead of the pure length, Gapcoin uses the “merit” of a prime gap, which is the ratio of the gap’s size to the average gap size. Let <tt>p</tt> be the prime starting a prime gap, then <tt>m = gapsize/log(p)</tt> will be the merit of this prime gap.<br /><br />Also a pseudo-random number is calculated from <tt>p</tt> to provide finer difficulty adjustment.<br /><br />Let <tt>rand(p)</tt> be a pseudo-random function with <tt>0 &lt; rand(p) &lt; 1</tt> Then, for a prime gap starting at prime <tt>p</tt> with size <tt>s</tt>, the difficulty will be <tt>s/log(p) + 2/log(p) &#8727; rand(p)</tt>, where <tt>2/log(p)</tt> is the average distance between a gap of size <tt>s</tt> and <tt>s + 2</tt> (the next greater gap) in the proximity of <tt>p</tt>.<br /><br />When it actually comes to mining, there are two additional fields added to the block header, named “shift” and “adder”. <br /><br />We will calculate the prime <tt>p</tt> as <tt>sha256(block header) &#8727; 2^shift + adder</tt>. As an additional criterion the adder has to be smaller than <tt>2^shift</tt> to avoid that the PoW could be reused. <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;"><b>Mining:</b></span><br /><br />For mining, PoWCore uses a basic prime sieve with some slightly improvements:<br /><br /><b>The sieving steps:</b><br /><br />Calculate the first <tt>n</tt> primes. In the actual sieve we skip all even numbers, because we want to only sieve the odd multiplies of each prime. So, we create an additional set of primes and multiply each with two. Make sure the <tt>start_index</tt> of the sieve is divisible by two.<br /><br />Now calculate for each prime the first odd number in the sieve, which is divisible by that prime (called <tt>pindex</tt>).<br /><br />For each prime <tt>p</tt>: mark the <tt>pindex</tt> as composite, add <tt>2 &#8727; p</tt> to <tt>pindex</tt> and mark it as composite, redo till we reach the end of the sieve.<br /><br /><span class="nb">For each remaining prime candidate, check primality with the Fermat-pseudo-prime-test as it is faster than the Miller-Rabin-test (Fermat is not as accurate as the Miller-Rabin and maybe some valid sieve results will not be accepted, but this should be very rare)</span><br /><br />Now scan the remaining (pseudo) primes for a big prime gap.<br /><br /><br /><b>Additional notes:</b><br /><br /><tt>start_index</tt> can be <tt>hash &#8727; 2^shift + [0, 2^shift)</tt><br /><br />max sieve size depends on <tt>start_index</tt>, and is limited by <tt>(hash + 2^shift) - start_index</tt>.<br /><br />shift can theoretically be in range <tt>[14, 2^16]</tt>, but nodes can choose to only accept shifts till a given amount (e.g. 512 for the main nodes)<br /><br /><br /><span class="nb"><b>dcct’s improvements</b></span><br /><br />We do not check every remaining prime candidate with the fermat test. Instead we look how large the gap has to be to fit the required difficulty (max_length). Then we determine the first prime in the sieve (called <tt>pstart</tt>). Now we scan the prime candidates in the range <tt>(pstart, pstart + max_length)</tt>. We start at the position <tt>(pstart + max_length)</tt> and scan every prime candidate in reverse order till we reach <tt>pstart</tt>.<br /><br />If we find a prime within the range <tt>(pstart, pstart + max_length)</tt> we can skip all other prime candidates within that range and set <tt>pstart</tt> to that prime. We redo the above process till we reach the end of the sieve.</div>

The miner sets up the sieve, in your case <tt>2^25</tt> (the shift being 25) and the resultant value as the required sieve size - 33554432. Now the question is how many primes to use.<br /><br />All the primes chosen are (from my understanding) each multiplied by 3, then the miner starts with the highest value <tt>prime*3</tt> and works backwards scanning for the desired gap length and not bothering with sections that obviously won’t net a coin. So the largest prime value(times 3) would ideally stop just short of the end of the sieve.<br /><br />So here is where a bit of math leg work comes in if you want to be precise. Absolute value of 33554432/3 is 11184810. The first prime less than that is 11184799. 11184799*3 is 33554397 which fits nicely near the top of the seive. A check of bigprimes.net shows it as the 737948th prime and thus the number of primes for shift 25.<br /><br />Can someone verify if this logic is correct? I think the default primes is 500000, Maybe it could be more efficient? Also we could build a table of primes for different shift values, perhaps blocks would be found faster if everyone wasn’t trying to scan <tt>2^25</tt> at the same time on each round.</div><span class="nb">Since revision 4, the default values are the same as from dcct’s mod:</span><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><pre style="margin-top: 0; display: inline;">--shift 25 --sieve-primes 900000 --sieve-size 33554432</pre></div>In the beginning, we sieve with the first n primes. For the first 2063689 primes, every prime eliminates at least one candidate in the sieve. For the primes behind that point, the possibility for eliminating a prime candidate in the sieve decreases.<br /><br />After sieving, the remaining prime candidates are scanned for prime gaps. When a prime is found while scanning the gap, the whole gap is skipped and the miner scans the next possible gap in the sieve.<br /><br />A more detailed description can be found here: <a class="ul" href="https://github.com/gapcoin/Gapcoin-PoWCore">https://github.com/gapcoin/Gapcoin-PoWCore</a></div>

In the first wallet version, every block was verified like it was in Bitcoin, but this takes too much time, so in version 2, Gapcoin uses Primecoin’s way and does not verifiy every already verified block on startup.

I know that reward also gets down but what about the second question?<br /></div>When mining Primecoin, you can easily “betray” the pool by modifying your miner to search only for smaller prime chains. With Gapcoin, this is not possible.<br /><br />In detail:<br /><br />When you searching for prime chains, you use a sieve for filtering prime candidates. If you search for a 10 chain, you sieve 10 times and eliminate all prime chain candidates that are smaller than 10. The primecoin pool then for example credits you for submitted 10-chain candidates that are only 7,8 or 9-chains.<br /><br />If you now sieve only 7 times, you will get a lot more 7-chain candidates. Not only is your calculating effort less, you will also find 7-chains that would not have been 10 chain candidates. The important point is, your chance of finding 10 chains drops while your chances of finding 7 chains rises.<br /><br />Pool operators have to implement something to handle such &quot;betrayers&quot;. With Gapcoin you don’t have this additional effort.</div>

Currently the miner is very experimental and needs to be tested, therefore I published the source code on github. The miner is a hybrid version of eXtremal’s fermat test and GapMiner’s sieve. The sieving is calculated on the cpu and the fermat tests are running on the GPU. Currently it is very (host) memory hungry about 1GB and you have to use one instance per gpu device.<br /><br />You can get it with:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><pre style="margin-top: 0; display: inline;">git clone https://github.com/gapcoin/GapMiner.git -b gpu-miner<br />cd GapMiner<br />git submodule init<br />git submodule update<br /></pre></div><br />It was built against amd app sdk v2.9 but maybe works with other versions too.

                <div class="postbody">Hi there,<br /><br />just wanted to give a little status update on the GPU-Miner.<br /><br />My current idea is to divide the sieve into parts of the required gap size, then apply dcct’s strategy to each of those parts, by start testing prime candidates from the end of the part and skipping those parts which have a prime in it.<br /><br />One problem is, that you have to store the first found prime (if there is one) from the previous part in the current part, to efficiently scan the whole sieve. This and some other related problems lead into very difficult code.<br /><br />Currently it’s produce invalid results most of the time, but I still think that it will give a reasonable speed increase to be worth the effort.<br /><br /></div>

                <div class="postbody">Hi there,<br /><br />I just want to inform you that Gapcoin just <b>broke 544 records</b> of first known occurrence prime gaps. The records are listed here: <a class="ul" href="http://www.trnicely.net/gaps/g4k.html">http://www.trnicely.net/gaps/g4k.html</a> and <a class="ul" href="http://www.trnicely.net/gaps/g6k.html">http://www.trnicely.net/gaps/g6k.html</a><br /><br />Even if we are currently a few of steps away from the world record of the highest merit primegap, I’m pretty sure Gapcoin can break some more records on those lists. All gaps found by the Gapcoin network can be download either as plaintext or zip from the website (<a class="ul" href="http://gapcoin.org/downloads.php">http://gapcoin.org/downloads.php</a>). The files are updated every hour.<br/><br/>I’m currently working on a method (involving Chinese remainder theorem) to improve the mining algorithm. (I’m not really sure if it can be applied to Gapcoin’s mining algorithm, but I’ll keep trying). I’ll also working on a tool for parsing and processing Gapcoins prime gaps. (both will be released here, when finished)</div>

                <div class="postbody">Hi there,<br /><br />It’s nice to see that some of you using higher shifts to find new records.<br /><br />Im currently working on new version of the Miner wich should speed up mining with higher shift by using the Chinese Reminder Theorem (CRT).<br /><br /><span class="nb">I tried long to improve mining by using the CRT, but couldn’t find a solution with gives a real speed improve. The thing is, to improve the mining speed with the CRT you have to use an higher shift, as higher the shift as bigger the improvement you make by using the CRT. But with higher shift the mining speed also decreases, so that you make no big improvement at all.<br /><br />But if you targeting higher shifts anyway, than the CRT could make a difference!</span> I’m currently testing my implementation within testnet, but It will still probably take some time till it’s ready. Just wanted to let you know, that I’m working on something.<br /><br />I also want to thank you all for the great support from all of you!</div>

There are different CRT files containing values optimized for a specific shift.<br /><br />There are 3 new verbose outputs:<br /><ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><li>gaps/s: The amount of gaps scanned per second</li><li>gaplist: The number of sieved gaps ready for scanning</li><li>block: The percent of the calculation amount of an average block</li></ul>The primes per second and the block percent values are estimated using the theoretical speed improve from the CRT, so they don’t have to be correct.<br /><br />Mining with the CRT is optimized for solo mining. You can mine at the pool, but you will probably mine less shares, and the pps and block values are probably incorrect, but your chance of finding a block is almost the same as when mining solo.<br /><br />Mining with the CRT is splitted in sieve and primality testing using separate threads for each:<div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><pre style="margin-top: 0; display: inline;">--threads 4 --fermat-threads 1<br /></pre></div>means: 3 sieve and 1 gap scan thread. So you have to use at least 2 threads.<br /><br />The scan threads always pick the most promising gap from the gaplist, therefore the gaplist value should always be at least over 100, but a too high gaplist value can slow down mining, (for example over 9000). You can alter <tt>--sieve-primes</tt>, <tt>--threads</tt> or <tt>--fermat-threads</tt> to achieve this. (<tt>--sieve-size</tt> is not used for CRT mining) FYI: The gaplist is implemented as an <a class="ul" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">heap</a><br /><br />The is also an logging version, which produces additional output in a gapminer.log file. If something goes wrong, you can switch versions, and look whats wrong, or at least give feedback.</div>

I.e. after mining x hours at 20000 primespersec you should find a block?<br />Or is it just totally random? There are people in the richlist that have 100+ coins. How did they manage to do that?<br /></div><br />If your primes per second are 25000 then you will need 760890487/25000 = 30435 seconds, which are about 8:30 hours.<br />So you will finde ~ 2.8 blocks per day.<br /><br />The rpc-call getmininginfo has a new value called gapsperday, which is calculated using the above formula.</div>

So we have to reach &nbsp;35.4245 difficulty. <br />Does that means that if hashrate never gets bigger we wont find record prime gaps?Even if we mine for much more time?<br />What &nbsp;hashrate should the network have &nbsp;so that we can reach that difficulty? I want to realize how fast we can actually reach that. Will it take some months or a year or 10 years?<br /><br />Of course i understand that better miners will come out and pools will help but i want to have a comparison.<br /></div><br />It’s not neccesary that the difficulty reaches 35.4245, we already have two ~28 merit gaps:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code"><pre style="margin-top: 0; display: inline;">[<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;time&quot; : &quot;2014-10-21 19:41:01 UTC&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;epoch&quot; : 1413920461,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;height&quot; : 240,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ismine&quot; : false,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;mineraddress&quot; : &quot;GXk8PfPwuDXQN5iQAypQFmS1LxArXtfY2L&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;gapstart&quot; : &quot;67692237123843296659418251254586218470394655850041287301830823121119920971930198957&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;gapend&quot; : &quot;67692237123843296659418251254586218470394655850041287301830823121119920971930204303&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;gaplen&quot; : 5346,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;merit&quot; : 28.02997943<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; },<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; {<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;time&quot; : &quot;2014-10-22 06:07:49 UTC&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;epoch&quot; : 1413958069,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;height&quot; : 737,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;ismine&quot; : false,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;mineraddress&quot; : &quot;Gcagtj5wCDHai4tJqJqTLTFwLBDaJnAA5u&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;gapstart&quot; : &quot;94715185144650972004538857957041135176651988819124169310707053830636479917687941569&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;gapend&quot; : &quot;94715185144650972004538857957041135176651988819124169310707053830636479917687947043&quot;,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;gaplen&quot; : 5474,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;merit&quot; : 28.65064563<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />]<br /></pre></div><br />You can use the &quot;listbestprimes&quot; rpc-call to list the gaps with the currently greatest merit.<br /><br />Within the test networks the greatest merits were mostly about 9 times greater than the difficulty, so we hopefully only need to reach a difficulty of 27.</div>
